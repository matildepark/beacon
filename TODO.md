- finish Beacon
- make Sentinel handle cards correctly (i.e. change state when UI changes state)
  - this is apparently something to do with the poke handling, which worked better with ``this` than now.
- write unit tests
- split into separate desks
- add hark-store notifications?
- provide %docs documentation
- provide %l10n localization
- improve visual styling
